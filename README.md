The app analyzes relationships between cards to create a personalized reading about your development journey.

## 🧠 Behind the Interpretation Engine

The app uses a sophisticated interpretation engine that:

1. Analyzes card categories (technical, growth, communication, etc.)
2. Identifies relationships between cards (compatible, conflicting, neutral)
3. Recognizes dominant themes in your reading
4. Generates personalized advice based on card combinations
5. Provides curated resources matching your unique reading

## 🌟 Future Development

- [ ] Add animated card flip effects
- [ ] Implement dark/light theme options
- [ ] Create weekly/monthly reading options
- [ ] Develop more specialized readings (career path, project success, etc.)
- [ ] Add sound effects and background music option
